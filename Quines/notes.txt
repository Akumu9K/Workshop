Difference between general quine relay and my quine relay

General:
[(A,B,C) A]
(A, B, C) A…
(B, C, A) 
(B, C, A) B
[(B, C, A) B]

The quine has a list of data and a program. 
The program advances the list/scrolls it by 1, then grabs the next program and puts it at the front.

Mine:

[[[-](B)B](A)A]
[[-](B)B](A) A…
[[-](B)B] [-](A)A
[[[-](A)A](B)B]

There is 2 quines held inside one bigger quine. When the program, one of the internal quines,
Is ran, it first replicates itself, then puts itself at the end,
Letting the next quine be the program for the next iteration

Regular Nested Quine Structure:

[[[-](B)B](A)A]
[[-](B)B](A) A...
[[-](B)B] (A)A . . .
[[-](B)B]
[[[[-](B)B]](B)B]

In the regular nested structure, a quine operates in one of the outer quine iterations, 
Then replicates the data into itself.

The difference is, mine puts its own copy into the data, while this puts the copy into itself.

General if it operated like mine (Kinda):

[(B,C) A]
(B,C) A...
(B,C,A)
[(C,A) B]

The major difference is, the general structure just scrolls and copies from a constant list,
While mine takes out the next iteration out of the list to be used, necessitating it to self replicate,
Since the copying process was not done, and then put its replication back in
